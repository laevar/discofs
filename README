fs2go is a FUSE filesystem which automatically mirrors a network filesystem
(e.g. nfs/cifs or whatever you like) to a local cache, making the files
available even if you're not connected to the corresponding host/network.

The main goal is to automatically synchronize a local version of the network
filesystem without the need of user interaction.

Changes made while "offline" are applied to the remote filesystem once the 
connection to the host/network is available.

Changes made on the remote side are detected by comparing each file's
MTIME/CTIME with the stored timestamp of the last synchronization.

For more details and usage see the manual.

(The name "fs2go" is a parody on a German pseudo-english term for "takeaway coffee".)
